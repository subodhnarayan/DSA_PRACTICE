 Implement Upper Bound

Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 52.54%Submissions: 67K+Points: 2
Given a sorted array arr[] and a number target, the task is to find the upper bound of the target in this given array.
The upper bound of a number is defined as the smallest index in the sorted array where the element is greater than the given number.

Note: If all the elements in the given array are smaller than or equal to the target, the upper bound will be the length of the array.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the smallest index in arr[], at which element (arr[3] = 10) is larger than 9.
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 11
Output: 6
Explanation: 6 is the smallest index in arr[], at which element (arr[6] = 25) is larger than 11.
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 100
Output: 7
Explanation: As no element in arr[] is greater than 100, return the length of array.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
1 ≤ target ≤ 106

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
